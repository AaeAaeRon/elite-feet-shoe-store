 This group project was created with JavaScript and React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. 
 PostgreSQL was used as the database. 
 
 This web app simulates a shoe store where you are able ot make purchases as well as add a shoe to their favorites.
 
 Once cloned you shoudl cd into the backend directory and run 'bundle install' and then 'rails s' the server shoudl be running
 on localhost:3000. Next cd into the frontend directory and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' the terminal will prompt you 
 that something is running on 3000 and would you like to run on a different port. Press 'y' and your app should run on 
 localhost:3001 where the apps home page is.
