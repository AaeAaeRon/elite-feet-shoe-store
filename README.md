 This group project was created with JavaScript and React for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. 
 PostgreSQL was used as the database. 
 
 This web app simulates a shoe store where you are able to make purchases as well as add a shoe to their favorites.
 
 Once cloned you should cd into the backend directory and run 'bundle install' and then 'rails s' the server should be running
 on localhost:3000. Next, cd into the frontend directory and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' the terminal will prompt you 
 that something is running on 3000 and will ask if you would like to run on a different port. Press 'y' and then enter and your 
 app should run on localhost:3001 where the apps home page is.
